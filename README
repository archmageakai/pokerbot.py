pokerbot.py interacts with giko.py in bar @ https://play.gikopoi.com
python3 pokerbot.py [room here, if blank defaults to bar]
refer to rooms.txt for rooms id

-enter a username (trips are accepted just add user#password..)
-choose to do (1) static bet amount or (2) percentage of your balance***

--- UPDATES ---

*** giko.py now has a CAPCODE, so this bot will recognize messages from giko.pyâ—†BOT only now
    prior to this, the bot could not run, so now that is fixed.

*** Please note that giko.py poker has been updated to cap bet amounts at 1000
    if you do use percentage of balance, giko.py makes any bet >1000 to 1000
    this bot is still functional, and you can still use bet percentages
    just know that anything >1000 for bets, just use static bets for 1000
    although even if you don't, giko.py wont rob your money!

--- To Do List ---
*** improve on ignoring or avoiding interruptions

*** if bot gets stuck, create an auto-reset
