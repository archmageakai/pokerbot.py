python3 pokerbot.py [room here, if blank defaults to bar]
refer to rooms.txt for rooms id

-enter a username (trips are accepted just add user#password..)
-choose to do (1) static bet amount or (2) percentage of your balance***

--- UPDATES ---

*** giko.py now has a CAPCODE, so this bot will recognize messages from 
    "giko.pyâ—†BOT" only now prior to this, the bot could not run, so now 
    that is fixed.

*** Please note that giko.py poker has been updated to cap bet amounts at 1000
    this bot is still functional, and you can still use bet percentages
    There is now a condition that if your percentage of balance bet is >1000,
    the bet will automatically be set to 1000 gikocoins.
    Bet away with this bot at percentage, and you'll be quickly on your way
    to betting at the new max bet of 1000 gikocoins!
    (took me 10min with a starting balance of 1000 gikocoins!!)

--- To Do List ---
*** improve on ignoring or avoiding interruptions

*** if bot gets stuck, create an auto-reset
